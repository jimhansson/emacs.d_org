This is my main .emacs file. It is responsible for calling out to the
local file at different points. This is placed in a git repository
that I share between work and home

* Introduction
  Basic things that could have been down throu custom-set-variable but
  then I would have harder time to replicate that between machines.

** Requirements

   - Emacs 24
   - a basic .emacs file that calls this after it inits org-babel 
   - a lot of extra packages. most configuration will check for it
     
** Other important stuff
*** Only load things that exists.

    that can be done this way, use this to avoid errors on machine
    which don't have every package installed.

    #+begin_example
      (when (require 'deft nil 'noerror) 
      (setq
         deft-extension "org"
         deft-directory "~/Org/deft/"
         deft-text-mode 'org-mode)
      (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") 'deft))
    #+end_example

** Setup

   Here we setup some basic things, I dont like the toolbar so that we
   turn off, I use OrgMode to almost everything(even my .emacs) so
   that will be my default mode. Almost all computers I use are
   laptops and who in there right mind uses 12h clocks.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq user-full-name "Jim Hansson")
     (tool-bar-mode -1)
     (setq default-major-mode 'org-mode)
     (add-hook 'text-mode-hooxk 'turn-on-auto-fill)
     ;; show matching paren
     (show-paren-mode t)
     (iswitchb-mode 1)
     (setq filesets-data nil)
     (display-battery-mode)
     (global-font-lock-mode t)
     ;; binds ctrl + ยง to dabbrev as good enough completion 
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-\ยง") 'dabbrev-expand)
   #+end_src

*** Modeline                                                       :modeline:
    
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      ;; Things that modifies the modeline
      (setq display-battery-mode t)
      (setq display-time-24hr-format t)
      ;; I work width some really big files and then it is good to have this
      ;; so i know how far down I am.
      (setq size-indication-mode t)
    #+end_src

** Uniquify                                                :uniquify:buffers:

   Better naming of buffers so we can easly tell the differens between
   buffers. Have some problem together with Iswitch

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'uniquify)
     (setq uniquify-buffer-name-style (quote post-forward))
   #+end_src

** Disable warnings for first time users
   
   For some reason some questions in emacs are yes/no and some are y/n
   this trips me sometimes so we turn that off, and the same goes for
   killing emacs. We also removes some questions that are asked to
   make sure that the users really wants what is going to happen, I
   know how to use undo and else I usually have some version control
   system running so I can go back.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Changes all yes/no questions to y/n type
     (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
     (set-variable 'confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)
     ;; more of these as I find them
     (put 'narrow-to-region 'disabled nil)
   #+end_src

* Iswitch Buffers                                                   :buffers:

  some text here.
  To prevent certain buffers from showing up in the completion list,
  set 'iswitchb-buffer-ignore': (setq iswitchb-buffer-ignore '("^ "
  "*Buffer")) This one is useful if you want to lose the *...*
  special buffers from the list. It's helpful if you're using the
  JDEE for editing Java apps, as you end up with buffers named
  org.whatever.package.Class which you might want to eliminate: (setq
  iswitchb-buffer-ignore '("^\\*")) To prevent switching to another
  frame, you can add the following to your configuration: (setq
  iswitchb-default-method 'samewindow)

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (iswitchb-mode 1)
    (setq iswitchb-default-method 'samewindow)
    ;; in your .emacs will allow left/right artist--arrow key navigation of the
    ;; buffer list, and deactivate up/down in iswitchb. Note that you
    ;; can by default use C-s and C-r to do this.  If the
    ;; below fails with "define-key: Symbol's function definition is
    ;; void: edmacro-parse-keys" you need to load the package defining
    ;; edmacro with (require 'edmacro).
    (defun iswitchb-local-keys ()
      (mapc (lambda (K) 
              (let* ((key (car K)) (fun (cdr K)))
                (define-key iswitchb-mode-map (edmacro-parse-keys key) fun)))
            '(("<right>" . iswitchb-next-match)
              ("<left>"  . iswitchb-prev-match)
              ("<up>"    . ignore             )
              ("<down>"  . ignore             ))))
    (add-hook 'iswitchb-define-mode-map-hook 'iswitchb-local-keys)
  #+end_src

** Iswitch and uniquify compabilitiy                                :uniquify:

   The library uniquify overrides Emacs default mechanism for making
   buffer names unique (using suffixes like <2>, <3> etc.) with a
   more sensible behaviour which use parts of the file names to make
   the buffer names distinguishable.  Additionally one can configure
   uniquify to rework the buffer names whenever a buffer is
   killed. This feature does not play well with IswitchBuffers
   function iswitchb-kill-buffer, bound to C-k. The following code
   instructs iswitchb-kill-buffer to update the buffer list after
   killing a buffer, so that a possible buffer renaming by uniquify
   is taken in account.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defadvice iswitchb-kill-buffer (after rescan-after-kill activate)
       "*Regenerate the list of matching buffer names after a kill.
     Nextcessary if using `uniquify' with `uniquify-after-kill-buffer-p'
     set to non-nil."
       (setq iswitchb-buflist iswitchb-matches)
       (iswitchb-rescan))
     
     (defun iswitchb-rescan ()
       "*Regenerate the list of matching buffer names."
       (interactive)
       (iswitchb-make-buflist iswitchb-default)
       (setq iswitchb-rescan t))
   #+end_src

** More Iswitch things that I don't use at the moment
*** Keybindings

    Something most IswitchBuffers users aren't aware of is that you
    can hit C-k to kill the currently selected buffer.

*** Using Iswitch-Buffer Programmatically
    
    From: KinCho
    Subject: my-icompleting-read
    Newsgroups: gnu.emacs.sources
    Date: Tue, 09 Oct 2001 16:28:18 GMT
    
    I used iswitchb for a while and really liked it. I began to
    explore to see if I can borrow iswitchb to make my scripts work
    like iswitchb as well. Well, it turned out iswitchb is coded in a
    way that makdes it really easy to borrow it to do regex-style
    completing-read: 

    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
    (defun my-icompleting-read(prompt choices)
    (let ((iswitchb-make-buflist-hook
    (lambda ()
    (setq iswitchb-temp-buflist choices))))
    (iswitchb-read-buffer prompt)))
    #+end_example

    Another example. Two things. "nil t" to iswitchb-read-buffer
    requires a choice from the given list with no default. Using an
    flet is a way to work when there's no hook variable. There is a
    hook variable. 

    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
    (defvar interesting  (regexp-opt '(".c" ".h" "etc.")))
    (defvar some-directory "/home/somewhere/etc/")

    ;; Making this more flexible is an exercise for the reader
    (defun find-a-file (arg &optional non-selective)
    "Select files using substrings."
    (interactive "sFile: ")
    (let ((dir (expand-file-name some-directory))
    candidates)
    (flet ((file-match (file)
    (if non-selective
    (string-match arg file)
    (and
    (string-match interesting file)
    (string-match arg file)))))
    (setq candidates (delq nil (loop for file in (directory-files dir)
    collect (if (file-match file) file)))))
    (cond
    ((eq (length candidates) 1)
    (find-file (format "%s%s" dir (car candidates))))
    ((eq (length candidates) 0)
    (if non-selective
    (message "No such file!")
    (find-a-file arg t)))
      (t
      (flet ((iswitchb-make-buflist (default)
      (setq iswitchb-buflist candidates)))
      (find-file (format 
      "%s%s" dir
      (iswitchb-read-buffer "File: " nil t))))))))
    #+end_example
      
    I'm quite new to iswitchb. I've been after eliminating the need to
    confirm (with TAB or ret) the last left possibility. 
      
    I've started with this simple hack, which only displays the
    desired buffer, but in this way, i don't need to look at the
    minibuffer (in some cases). 
    
    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
    (defun iswitchb-post-command ()
    "Run after command in 'iswitchb-buffer'."
    (iswitchb-exhibit)
    (if (= (length iswitchb-matches) 1)
    (display-buffer (car iswitchb-matches))))
    #+end_example
    
    another thing i like, is to have the freedom to decide to open the
    buffer in other-window/frame after i made the selection: Hence a
    new minibuffer exiting command: 
    
    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
    (defun iswitchb-select-buffer-other-window ()
    "Select the buffer named by the prompt. But in another window."
    (interactive)
    (setq iswitchb-method 'otherwindow)
    (exit-minibuffer))
    #+end_example
    
    The functionality of iswitchb can also be used to provide a
    replacement for the usual behaviour of find-file. Instead of
    hitting Tab to bring up a buffer listing the possible file
    completions, a list of file completions is continuously updated in
    the minibuffer: 
    
    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
    (defun exd-find-file ()
    "Use functionality from `iswitchb' as a replacement for `find-file'"
    (interactive)
    (find-file (exd-iswitchb-find-file "." (directory-files "."))))
    
    (defun exd-iswitchb-find-file (dir file-list)
    "Use functionality from `iswitchb' to select a file for `find-file'.
    If a directory is selected, enter that directory and generate a new
    list from which to select a file."
    ;; sort the file list into directories first
    (setq file-list
    (sort file-list
    (lambda (elt-1 elt-2)
    (and (file-directory-p (concat dir "/" elt-1))
    (not (file-directory-p (concat dir "/" elt-2)))))))
    ;; use iswitchb for minibuffer file list/completion magic
    (let* (resize-mini-windows
    (iswitchb-make-buflist-hook
    (lambda ()
    (setq iswitchb-temp-buflist file-list)))
    ;; get the selected file
    (selected-file (concat dir "/" (iswitchb-read-buffer
    (concat "Find File: "
    (expand-file-name dir)
    "/")))))
    ;; if the selected file is a directory, recurse, else return file
    (if (file-directory-p selected-file)
    (exd-iswitchb-find-file selected-file (directory-files selected-file))
    selected-file)))
    #+end_example
    
    See Also:
    
    Icicles, and command 'icicle-buffer', which is similar to
    'iswitchb-buffer' but provides some additional features. Also,
    Icicles treats all types of minibuffer input the same way:
    filenames, buffer names, commands, variables...everything. And it
    lets you use a regexp to match completions, if you like. 
    InteractivelyDoThings (ido), which implements regex selection for
    files, directory buffers etc...

** Flymake
*** Flymake Cursor

    The normal operation of flymake allows the user to see the error
    message for a particular line by โhoveringโ the mouse over the
    line. This is inconvenient for people who try to use the keyboard
    for all input. FlymakeCursor was designed to address that: it
    displays the flymake error in the minibuffer region, when the
    cursor is placed on a line containing a flymake error. 

    This works in any language that flymake supports

* Fly-spell

  My spelling is terrible so we use fly-spell as much as possible when
  it is available. We turn it on for most text-modes and
  flyspell-prog-mode for programming. 

  I highly suggest setting โflyspell-issue-message-flagโ to nil, as
  printing messages for every word (when checking the entire buffer)
  causes an enormous slowdown. 

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (when (require 'flyspell nil 'noerror)
      ;; activate flyspell for text-mode and derivatives
      (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook))
        (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1))))
      ;; this is how we remove it for a sub-mode
      ;;(dolist (hook '(change-log-mode-hook log-edit-mode-hook))
      ;;  (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode -1))))
      )

    (setq flyspell-issue-message-flag nil)
  #+end_src

** Fly-spell for comments when programming                            :coding:

     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
               (lambda ()

** TODO word-list for org-files.
   
   org-files contains some reserved words like #+begin_* ... these
   should be included in some sort of wordlist we use. so we don't get
   a lot of errors on those files.

** TODO don't use flyspell in src samples
   
   Or switch to flyspell-prog-mode somehow.

** TODO Avoid false positives

   I recently started using flyspell and am enjoying its features. Is
   there a way to disable flyspell for certain regexps? For instance,
   I would like to disable flyspell when typing a url. Otherwise, when
   entering a url such as
   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/FlySpell, www, emacswiki,
   cgi and FlySpell are highlighted as errors. Any advice would be
   greatly appreciated. โ MattLundin 

   There is only one way, using flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate
   which should be a function. In such a function you can use thing at
   point. 

   However it is a bit difficult to manage this as this variable may
   be only one function. I have submitted a patch to Emacs devel to
   take care of this. 

   Thanks for pointing me to the flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate
   variable. โ MattLundin

*** Change dictionaries

    As I often need to switch between English and German I use this
    function:

    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
      (defun fd-switch-dictionary()
      (interactive)
      (let* ((dic ispell-current-dictionary)
    	 (change (if (string= dic "deutsch8") "english" "deutsch8")))
        (ispell-change-dictionary change)
        (message "Dictionary switched from %s to %s" dic change)
        ))
    
      (global-set-key (kbd "<f8>")   'fd-switch-dictionary)
    #+end_example

    I too cycle through different languages, but not all that is
    available in the system. I use the following code inside my
    .emacs. 

    #+begin_example emacs-lisp
    (let ((langs '("american" "francais" "brasileiro")))
      (setq lang-ring (make-ring (length langs)))
      (dolist (elem langs) (ring-insert lang-ring elem)))

    (defun cycle-ispell-languages ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((lang (ring-ref lang-ring -1)))
        (ring-insert lang-ring lang)
        (ispell-change-dictionary lang)))

    (global-set-key [f6] 'cycle-ispell-languages)
    #+end_example

    How can I ignore or add a word without using the popup menu?

    Use flyspell-auto-correct-word.

    This is not working for me. With flyspell-auto-correct-word I can
    go through all suggestions for correction, but I do not get an
    option to insert the word into my dictionary. Success in adding
    new words into the personal dictionary.

    I used โM x ispell-regionโ, and the words that ispell considered
    having incorrect spellings were highlighted. The point moved to
    the first โmis-spelledโ word. By typing โiโ, I inserted the word
    into my personal dictionary. Later I found that the personal
    dictionary was stored in the file $HOME/.aspell.en.pws in pure
    text format. Although the word was added when I used โispellโ
    instead of โflyspellโ, but once added, flyspell also recognized
    the word as having a correct spelling. :-) This information came
    from the web page:
    http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_109.html . Thanks! 

    Easy Spell Check: key bindings and function to make
    FlySpell/ispell/aspell easy to use w/ out a mouse 

    Place the below code in your .emacs

    F8 will call ispell (or aspell, etc) for the word the cursor is on
    (or near). You can also use the built-in key binding
    M-$. Ctrl-Shift-F8 enables/disables FlySpell for your current
    buffer (highlights misspelled words as you type) Crtl-Meta-F8 runs
    FlySpell on your current buffer (highlights all misspelled words
    in the buffer) Ctrl-F8 calls ispell for the FlySpell highlighted
    word prior to the cursorโs position Meta-F8 calls ispell for the
    FlySpell highlighted word after the cursorโs position.

    #+begin_example emacs-lisp

** Init

   because I have more than one computer and also a work computer, I
   have split my org agenda files into two parts. One that I share
   between computers and one that is local to that machine(or
   filesystem I am working in). To Make configuration of org-agenda
   work with this I have files that I call in my shared org directory
   and in my local directory. So here is the first call.

* Load Local settings

  Last but not least we need to load the part of the .emacs that is

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

* Filesets                                                          :filesets:

The commands that can operate on file sets are specified in the global
custom variable "filesets-commands". You can add your own commands to
that list. The default value for this variable is: 

("Isearch" multi-isearch-files
  (filesets-cmd-isearch-getargs))
 ("Isearch (regexp)" multi-isearch-files-regexp
  (filesets-cmd-isearch-getargs))
 ("Query Replace" perform-replace
  (filesets-cmd-query-replace-getargs))
 ("Query Replace (regexp)" perform-replace
  (filesets-cmd-query-replace-regexp-getargs))
 ("Grep <<selection>>" "grep"
  ("-n " filesets-get-quoted-selection " " "<<file-name>>"))
 ("Run Shell Command" filesets-cmd-shell-command
  (filesets-cmd-shell-command-getargs)))

The values consist of an association list of names, functions, and an
argument list (or a function that returns one) to be run on a
filesets' files. So, if you wanted to add a command that does an
"occur" command on the file set, you could use the "Isearch" entry as
an example to create your own new entry (that you would add to the
"filesets-commands" global variable) that would look something like: 

 ("Occur (regexp)" multi-occur-files-regexp
  (filesets-cmd-occur-getargs))

You would need to write the "multi-occur-files-regexp" and
"filesets-cmd-occur-getargs" functions (you could use the existing
"multi-isearch-files-regexp" and "filesets-cmd-isearch-getargs"
functions as a basis since they would be similar). The same would
apply for any additional Emacs command that you wanted to add to work
on file sets.
