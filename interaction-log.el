;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This package provides a buffer *Emacs Log* showing the last hit
;;; keys and executed commands, messages and file loads in
;;; chronological order.  This enables you to reconstruct the last
;;; seconds of your work with Emacs.
;;;
;;; Installation: Put this file in your load path and byte-compile it.
;;; To start logging automatically at startup, add this to your init
;;; file:
;;;
;;; (require 'interaction-log)
;;; (interaction-log-mode +1)
;;;
;;; You probably will want to have a hotkey for showing the log
;;; buffer, so also add something like
;;;
;;; (global-set-key [f1] (lambda () (interactive) (display-buffer ilog-buffer-name)))
;;;
;;; Usage: Use `interaction-log-mode' to toggle logging.  Enabling the
;;; mode will cause all messages and all pressed keys (along with the
;;; actually executed command and the according buffer) to be logged
;;; in the background.  Also loading of files will be logged - in a
;;; tree-style manner for recursive loads.  If an executed command
;;; causes any buffer to change, it will be highlighted in orange so
;;; you can check if you made changes by accident.  If a command
;;; caused any message to be displayed in the echo area (e.g. if an
;;; error occurred), it is highlighted in red.
;;; 
;;; If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please
;;; tell me!
